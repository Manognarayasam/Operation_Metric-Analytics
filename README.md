**Operation_Metric-Analytics**

Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company. With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon. You work closely with the ops team, support team, marketing team, etc and help them derive insights out of the data they collect. Being one of the most important parts of a company, this kind of analysis is further used to predict the overall growth or decline of a company’s fortune. It means better automation, better understanding between cross-functional teams, and more effective workflows. Investigating metric spike is also an important part of operation analytics as being a Data Analyst you must be able to understand or make other teams understand questions like- Why is there a dip in daily engagement? Why have sales taken a dip? Etc. Questions like these must be answered daily and for that it’s very important to investigate metric spike. You are working for a company like Microsoft designated as Data Analyst Lead and is provided with different data sets, tables from which you must derive certain insights out of it and answer the questions asked by different departments.

**Analysis:** 
Steps taken are 

•	Importing the data set into SQL .

•	Doing the exploratory data analysis.

•	Writing the quires to get the desired results.

**Problem:**
